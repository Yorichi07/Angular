What is Angular?
It is a front-end framework build using the JavaScript by Google.

It helps with building interactive, modern web user interfaces. It's also a collection of tools & features (CLI, Debugging Tools, IDE Plugins).

Why Angular?
Simplifies the process of building complex, interactive web user interfaces.
1) Write declaritive code - Making the code more readable and easier to understand by focusing on what the application should do rather than how to do it.
2) Separation of concerns via components - Ensures a clear separation of concerns, enabling modular development, easier maintenance, and better reusability of code.
3) OOPs concepts & principles -  Leads to more scalable and maintainable applications.
4) Use Typescript - Typescript is a JS Superset - an extension of JS. It support strong & strict typing unlike "Vanilla JS". It enforces types and prevent unexpected value type changes. With TS you can often  detect errors early on during developement.

npm will act as package manager for Angular application.

Install AngularCLI - npm install -g @angular/cli@17
Make your first angular application - ng new first-angular-app
Run npm start in terminal of your app, you will get a Local address of your application.

String Interpolation {{}}- to refer element in html from .ts component. Ex- <span>{{selectedUser.name}}</span>

Property Binding - a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties to dynamic values.
Ex- <img [src]="'assests/users/'+selectedUser.avatar"/>

Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow you to bind attributes to dynamic values.

It looks like this:

<div 
  role="progressbar" 
  [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal" 
  [attr.aria-valuemax]="maxVal">...</div>
By adding attr in front of the attribute name you want to bind dynamically, you're "telling" Angular that it shouldn't try to find a property with the specified name but instead bind the respective attribute - in the example above, the aria-valuenow and aria-valuemax attributes would be bound dynamically.

There are two approches for updating state of Angular Application after a change occur:
1) Zone.js - Works automatically, no special instructions required. Supported since Angular2
2) signal - requires usage of special "signal" instruction & code. Support since Angular16
